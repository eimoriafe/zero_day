### My first project as a fullstack Software Engineer

This is the first page of my project on github.
I have begun to learn the key fundamental skills required to become a professional Software engineer. 

My career options are :

* Software Engineer
* Network development engineer.
* Network automation engineer.
* CyberSecurity Engineer.
* Backend Engineer.

As they say in life > Nothing good comes easy

I have learnt how to use git commands like
`git init`
`git push`

Please do follow me as I continue to grow and add more content and material.

Wish me luck.
